# Quantum Number System Glossary

## Core Terms

### Quantum Number
A 256-bit atomic symbolic numeric unit that serves as the fundamental building block of the Quantum Number System. Composed of twelve 20-bit signed integer fields (a-l), twelve independent sign bits, and a 4-bit checksum, representing a structured nested division expression that enables exact, symbolic, and reversible mathematical computation.

### Quantum Operating System (QOS)
A next-generation operating system architecture designed from the ground up to support native 256-bit symbolic numeric types, asynchronous symbolic computation, quantum-aware arithmetic, and AI-native workflows with full traceability and explainability.

### Quantum File System (QFS)
A symbolic data storage format that stores data as symbolic expressions, Quantum ASTs, and transformations, supporting immutable symbolic math states, proof-carrying expressions, deferred evaluation, and AI-native persistence with transformation history.

### Quantum Hardware
A new class of hardware architecture designed for native execution of Quantum Numbers and quantum symbolic computation, including specialized processors, registers, and arithmetic logic units built around 256-bit wide symbolic numeric units.

### x256 Architecture
A novel 256-bit processor architecture developed specifically to implement Quantum Hardware principles, supporting native Quantum Number arithmetic, direct hardware execution of Quantum AST operations, and symbolic divide-by-zero handling.

## Mathematical Concepts

### Minimum Unit
The base, indivisible 256-bit Quantum Number unit composed of 12 ordinals (a-l), 12 independent sign bits, and a 4-bit checksum, representing a structured nested division expression that is symbolic and non-collapsible by design.

### Standard Unit
A Quantum Number formed by summing a finite or infinite list of Minimum Units, enabling infinite precision across the number line and lossless accumulation without overflow or rounding.

### AST Unit
The highest-level representation: a fully symbolic, hierarchical mathematical computation tree with Quantum Numbers as leaves and operations as branches, capable of modeling entire mathematical systems including universes and multiverses.

### Quantum Abstract Syntax Tree (Quantum AST)
A symbolic expression structure where nodes encode both values and operations in a compositional structure preserving full mathematical order and structure, organizing Quantum Numbers into complex mathematical expressions.

### Quantition
The process of symbolic evaluation and transformation of deferred divide-by-zero components and quantum expressions, converting symbolic representations into rational or real equivalents when needed while preserving mathematical structure.

## Hardware Components

### Symbolic Arithmetic Logic Unit (SALU)
A specialized ALU designed for 256-bit Quantum Number operations, supporting symbolic arithmetic while maintaining expression trees and mathematical structure.

### Quantum Register File (QRF)
A register file containing 256-bit wide registers (Q0-Q31, QS0-QS7, QRPC) designed to store full Quantum Numbers with sign bits, checksums, and direct hardware AST references.

### Quantum Control Unit (QCU)
The control unit that orchestrates symbolic instruction decoding and scheduling, manages deferred evaluation requests, and triggers quantition processes asynchronously.

### Quantum Memory Management Unit (QMMU)
A memory management unit supporting Quantum File System integration with symbolic storage, managing persistent symbolic state, proofs, and cryptographic integrity of data.

## Software Components

### Quantum Symbolic ISA (QS-ISA)
The instruction set architecture for x256 processors, defining quantum arithmetic instructions, AST manipulation instructions, control instructions, and memory instructions for symbolic computation.

### Quantition Unit
Dedicated hardware for symbolic evaluation of deferred divide-by-zero and quantum expressions, supporting stepwise transformation of ASTs with intermediate state storage.

### Quantum Number Literals
Special syntax for specifying Quantum Numbers in assembly language using structured field notation with ordinals, signs, and checksums.

## System Architecture

### Fibre-Linked Memory Model
A memory architecture where memory chips and modules are interconnected via high-speed fibre-optic links, supporting 256-bit wide address and data buses for scalable, distributed memory architectures.

### Symbolic Memory
Memory regions explicitly designed for storing symbolic expressions, quantition buffers, and raw Quantum Numbers with metadata tags indicating data type and symbolic state.

### Quantum-Native AI
Artificial intelligence systems built on Quantum Number foundations, enabling explainable AI through symbolic reasoning, exact neural network computations, and quantum-aware machine learning algorithms.

## Mathematical Properties

### Exact Mathematics
Mathematical computation that eliminates approximation errors inherent in floating-point systems by maintaining full symbolic structure and precision throughout all operations.

### Symbolic Computation
Mathematical processing that preserves mathematical structure and derivation history, maintaining the relationships and operations that produced each result.

### Infinite Precision
The ability to represent and compute with arbitrary precision across any scale, from subatomic to cosmological, without loss of accuracy or overflow.

### Reversible Computation
Mathematical operations that preserve enough information to reverse the computation, enabling mathematical proof verification and exact symbolic manipulation.

## Application Domains

### Quantum Number [Field]
A placeholder term representing any scientific, engineering, or computational discipline that incorporates the Quantum Number system, where [Field] can be any domain such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Electronics, AI, etc.

### Universe Modeling
The capability to represent and simulate entire universes as computable, symbolic entities using Quantum AST structures.

### Multiverse Modeling
The extension of universe modeling to multiple universes, supporting infinite layers of universes and transfinite mathematical concepts.

### Complex Number Support
Native representation and manipulation of complex numbers (real + imaginary components) critical for electronics, electromagnetic theory, and quantum mechanics.

## Legal and Licensing

### Prior Art
The legal establishment of public disclosure and documentation of inventions and concepts to prevent future exclusive patenting or ownership by third parties.

### Apache License 2.0
The open-source license under which the Quantum Number System is released, enabling open innovation while retaining authorship and preventing monopolization.

### Wildcard Definition Clause
A legal clause ensuring comprehensive coverage of Quantum Number terminology across all present and future domains where the framework may be applied.
