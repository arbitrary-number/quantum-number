# x256 Chip Design Document

## Overview

The **x256** is a next-generation 256-bit processor architecture designed explicitly to support native execution of **Quantum Numbers** and symbolic quantum arithmetic. The chip redefines processor architecture away from traditional binary arithmetic towards quantum-symbolic computation, enabling advanced AI, quantum math, and symbolic processing workloads.

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Native Quantum Number Support

- Registers and ALUs are 256-bit wide, directly matching the Quantum Number structure.  
- Arithmetic operations are defined on Quantum Numbers, supporting symbolic fields and sign bits intrinsically.  
- Divide-by-zero and symbolic expressions are natively handled as part of the instruction semantics, deferring evaluation until quantition.

### 2.2 Symbolic Computation Pipeline

- The pipeline supports storing intermediate symbolic states instead of raw numerical values.  
- Instructions produce and consume Quantum AST nodes internally, maintaining expression trees at the hardware level.  
- Enables explainability and traceability of AI computations through hardware.

### 2.3 Quantum Control Unit (QCU)

- Orchestrates symbolic instruction decoding and scheduling.  
- Manages deferred evaluation requests and triggers quantition processes asynchronously.

### 2.4 Quantum Memory Management Unit (QMMU)

- Supports Quantum File System integration with symbolic storage.  
- Manages persistent symbolic state, proofs, and cryptographic integrity of data.  
- Provides memory-mapped Quantum Number registers for efficient I/O.

## 3. Register File (Quantum Register File - QRF)

| Register Name | Size (bits) | Description                                |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Q0 - Q31      | 256         | General-purpose Quantum Number registers   |
| QS0 - QS7     | 256         | Special symbolic state registers            |
| QRPC          | 64          | Quantum return program counter (symbolic) |

- Registers store full Quantum Numbers with sign bits and checksums.  
- Supports direct hardware AST references for lazy evaluation.

## 4. Instruction Set Architecture (QS-ISA)

### 4.1 Instruction Formats

- **Quantum Arithmetic Instructions:** Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide (symbolic-aware)  
- **AST Manipulation Instructions:** CreateNode, CollapseNode, QuantitionTrigger  
- **Control Instructions:** QuantumBranch, QuantumCall, QuantumReturn  
- **Memory Instructions:** QuantumLoad, QuantumStore (symbolic memory-aware)

### 4.2 Sample Instruction Descriptions

| Instruction         | Opcode | Description                                                       |
|---------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| QADD Qd, Qa, Qb     | 0x10   | Symbolic addition of Quantum Numbers Qa and Qb → Qd              |
| QDIV Qd, Qa, Qb     | 0x14   | Symbolic division, defers divide-by-zero handling until quantition |
| QCREATE_NODE Qd, Op, Qa, Qb | 0x20   | Creates AST node with operation Op and operands Qa, Qb → Qd  |
| QQUANTITION_TRIGGER Qx | 0x30   | Initiates quantition process on AST rooted at Qx                 |

## 5. Pipeline and Execution

- **Fetch:** Quantum instructions fetched from Quantum File System or cache  
- **Decode:** Decoded into symbolic operations preserving AST references  
- **Execute:** Operations performed on Quantum Numbers with symbolic metadata  
- **Memory:** Symbolic loads/stores maintain expression state and integrity  
- **Writeback:** Results include updated Quantum Numbers or AST roots  

Out-of-order execution supports speculative symbolic computations with rollback on invalid quantition.
