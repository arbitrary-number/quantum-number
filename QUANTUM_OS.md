## Executive Summary

Quantum OS represents the first operating system designed specifically for symbolic mathematical computation, providing native support for Quantum Numbers, x256 architecture, and advanced mathematical operations at the kernel level. This document establishes the foundational design principles and technical specifications for this revolutionary operating system.

## 1. Core Architecture

### 1.1 Kernel Design Philosophy

```

**Allocation Characteristics:**
