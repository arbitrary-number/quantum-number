# Quantum Number System, Quantum Operating System, Quantum File System & Quantum Hardware

## Overview

This project introduces a new class of computational and symbolic infrastructure for AI and quantum-native computing, based around five foundational components:

- **Quantum Number**: a 256-bit atomic symbolic numeric unit  
- **Quantum Operating System (QOS)**: an AI-first OS architecture built around exact symbolic computation  
- **Quantum File System (QFS)**: a symbolic data representation and storage format supporting native quantum numbers  
- **Quantum Hardware**: a new generation of hardware designed specifically to support 256-bit symbolic numeric operations natively  
- **x256 Chip Design**: a 256-bit processor architecture optimized for Quantum Numbers and quantum symbolic arithmetic  

All components are released under the Apache License 2.0, establishing prior art and enabling open innovation while retaining authorship.

## üìò What Is a Quantum Number?

**Quantum Number** (capitalized as a formal term) is a 256-bit atomic symbolic unit used for non-collapsible mathematical and algebraic expression.

### Formal Definition

> A Quantum Number is a binary structure composed of twelve 20-bit signed integer fields (with sign bits), plus a 4-bit checksum, forming a total of 256 bits.  
>  
> It can represent mathematical constants, symbolic operations, or quantum algebra elements. It supports exact symbolic manipulation, including well-defined symbolic divide-by-zero components that are transformed via a process called _quantition_.

Quantum Numbers enable:

- Hardware-native symbolic computation  
- Non-approximated, reversible math  
- Complex composition via ASTs  
- Pure symbolic logic for explainable AI and quantum algorithms  

---

## üß† Quantum AST

Quantum Numbers are organized into symbolic expressions using a **Quantum Abstract Syntax Tree (Quantum AST)**, where nodes encode both values and operations in a compositional structure preserving full mathematical order and structure.

---

## üß¨ What Is a Quantum Operating System (QOS)?

**Quantum Operating System (QOS)** is a next-generation operating system architecture designed from the ground up to support:

- Native 256-bit symbolic numeric types (Quantum Numbers)  
- Asynchronous and symbolic computation (AST-driven)  
- Quantum-aware arithmetic and logic  
- AI-native workflows, traceability, and explainability  
- Direct interaction with symbolic hardware components  

QOS abandons legacy 32/64-bit architectures in favor of a new symbolic standard, forming the foundation for computation in the quantum AI era.

---

## üßæ What Is a Quantum File System (QFS)?

**Quantum File System (QFS)** is a symbolic data storage format aligned with the Quantum Number paradigm. It stores data as symbolic expressions, Quantum ASTs, and transformations in a structure that supports:

- Immutable symbolic math states  
- Proof-carrying expressions  
- Deferred evaluation  
- Cryptographic integrity and explainability  
- AI-native persistence, traceability, and transformation history  

QFS replaces byte-based, string-based, or stream-based file formats with symbolic-math-native storage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Is Quantum Hardware?

**Quantum Hardware** is a new class of hardware architecture and design principles tailored for the native execution of Quantum Numbers and quantum symbolic computation. It includes specialized processors, registers, and arithmetic logic units built around 256-bit wide symbolic numeric units.

---

## üîß What Is the x256 Chip Design?

The **x256** is a novel 256-bit processor architecture developed specifically to implement Quantum Hardware principles. It supports:

- Native Quantum Number arithmetic  
- Direct hardware execution of Quantum AST operations  
- Symbolic divide-by-zero handling via built-in quantition circuits  
- Integration with Quantum Operating System and Quantum File System  

x256 represents a fundamental departure from conventional 64-bit architectures towards quantum-symbolic-aware computation.
