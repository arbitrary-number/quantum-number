# Quantum Number System, Quantum Operating System & Quantum File System

## Overview

This project introduces a new class of computational and symbolic infrastructure for AI and quantum-native computing, based around three foundational components:

- **Quantum Number**: a 256-bit atomic symbolic numeric unit
- **Quantum Operating System (QOS)**: an AI-first OS architecture built around exact symbolic computation
- **Quantum File System (QFS)**: a symbolic data representation and storage format supporting native quantum numbers

All components are released under the Apache License 2.0, establishing prior art and enabling open innovation while retaining authorship.

## 📘 What Is a Quantum Number?

**Quantum Number** (capitalized as a formal term) is a 256-bit atomic symbolic unit used for non-collapsible mathematical and algebraic expression.

### Formal Definition

> A Quantum Number is a binary structure composed of twelve 20-bit signed integer fields (with sign bits), plus a 4-bit checksum, forming a total of 256 bits.  
>  
> It can represent mathematical constants, symbolic operations, or quantum algebra elements. It supports exact symbolic manipulation, including well-defined symbolic divide-by-zero components that are transformed via a process called _quantition_.

Quantum Numbers enable:

- Hardware-native symbolic computation
- Non-approximated, reversible math
- Complex composition via ASTs
- Pure symbolic logic for explainable AI and quantum algorithms

---

## 🧠 Quantum AST

Quantum Numbers are organized into symbolic expressions using a **Quantum Abstract Syntax Tree (Quantum AST)**, where nodes encode both values and operations in a compositional structure preserving full mathematical order and structure.

---

## 🧬 What Is a Quantum Operating System (QOS)?

**Quantum Operating System (QOS)** is a next-generation operating system architecture designed from the ground up to support:

- Native 256-bit symbolic numeric types (Quantum Numbers)
- Asynchronous and symbolic computation (AST-driven)
- Quantum-aware arithmetic and logic
- AI-native workflows, traceability, and explainability
- Direct interaction with symbolic hardware components

QOS abandons legacy 32/64-bit architectures in favor of a new symbolic standard, forming the foundation for computation in the quantum AI era.

---

## 🧾 What Is a Quantum File System (QFS)?

**Quantum File System (QFS)** is a symbolic data storage format aligned with the Quantum Number paradigm. It stores data as symbolic expressions, Quantum ASTs, and transformations in a structure that supports:

- Immutable symbolic math states
- Proof-carrying expressions
- Deferred evaluation
- Cryptographic integrity and explainability
- AI-native persistence, traceability, and transformation history

QFS replaces byte-based, string-based, or stream-based file formats with symbolic-math-native storage.
