# Quantum Qubit Simulation Using Quantum Numbers on x64 Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines a novel approach to simulating qubits on classical x64 processors by leveraging a unique algebraic framework called **Quantum Numbers** — non-collapsible nested fractions with defined division by zero. This method encodes quantum states and gates algebraically, enabling potential error correction and quantum gate simulation on classical hardware.

## 1. Quantition Number Representation of Qubits

- **Qubit state:** |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α, β ∈ ℂ and |α|² + |β|² = 1.
- **Encoding:** Each complex amplitude α, β is mapped to components of a Quantun Number:

Q = ((±a ± gi) / ((±b ± hi) / (±c ± ii))) ÷ (((±d ± ji) / (±e ± ki)) / (±f ± li))

- This nested fractional structure provides a rich algebraic space to represent quantum superpositions and complex amplitudes.

## 2. Quantum Gates as Quantition Transformations

- Quantum gates are modeled as **additive transformations** on Quantum numbers:

ψ' = ψ + T

where T is another quantition number encoding the gate operation.

- Standard gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Phase, etc.) correspond to specific quantition transformations designed to reproduce their matrix actions on qubit amplitudes.

## 3. Arithmetic Implementation on x64

- Implement core quantition arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division including division by zero) optimized for x64 architectures.
- Use assembly or SIMD instructions for efficient parallel computation.
- Maintain numerical stability and precision throughout nested fractional operations.

---

## 4. Multi-Qubit Simulation and Entanglement

- Extend the quantition representation to encode multi-qubit states via algebraic tensor products or equivalent constructions.
- Model entangling gates (CNOT, CZ) as complex quantition transformations that preserve non-collapsibility and coherence properties.
- Ensure algebraic consistency to maintain entanglement fidelity during simulation.

---

## 5. Measurement Simulation

- Simulate quantum measurement by projecting quantition states onto basis states.
- Implement probabilistic sampling weighted by squared amplitude magnitudes extracted algebraically.
- Model state collapse through algebraic mechanisms involving quantition non-collapsibility.

---

## 6. Benefits and Future Work

- **Intrinsic Error Correction:** Quantition algebra’s structure supports error correction at the algebraic level, potentially reducing overhead.
- **New Simulation Paradigm:** Provides an alternative to traditional complex vector space simulation using classical floating-point arithmetic.
- **Scalability Challenges:** Further research needed to efficiently simulate large multi-qubit systems.
- **Quantum Algorithm Implementation:** Next steps include implementing Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms within this framework.
