/**
 * Represents a symbolic, exact, and mutable numeric unit designed for
 * infinite-precision arithmetic across the full number line.
 *
 * <p>This structure models numbers as a fixed expression of the form:
 * <pre>
 *     (a / (b / c)) * (d / (e / f))
 * </pre>
 * where each of {@code a, b, c, d, e, f} are composed of four 64-bit words,
 * allowing 256-bit precision per component.
 *
 * <p><b>Key Characteristics:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Exact Math:</b> No floating-point rounding errors or approximations.
 *       All operations are represented structurally and precisely.</li>
 *   <li><b>Mutable Structure:</b> Fields can be incremented or decremented to
 *       perform arithmetic operations.</li>
 *   <li><b>Division by Zero Supported:</b> Dividing by zero is a valid state,
 *       representing symbolic or dual-purpose numbers rather than errors.</li>
 *   <li><b>Signed Zero:</b> Metadata fields encode sign information allowing
 *       distinction between +0 and -0, which is meaningful throughout computations.</li>
 *   <li><b>Coefficient Scaling:</b> The second half
 *       <code>(d / (e / f))</code> acts as a scaling coefficient that can
 *       scale the base number arbitrarily up or down via additive increments.</li>
 *   <li><b>Instant Multiplication and Division:</b> Multiplication and division
 *       by powers of two or other factors are performed by simple addition or
 *       incrementing internal fields â€” no actual CPU multiplication or division
 *       instructions are required.</li>
 *   <li><b>Array Representation:</b> An array of {@code QuantumNumberV8} instances
 *       represents a sum of numbers, supporting exact addition across the infinite
 *       number line and enabling precise linear combinations.</li>
 *   <li><b>Intel x64 Memory Layout:</b> The class layout models native 256-bit
 *       words to facilitate efficient memory-mapped access and native calls
 *       via JNA (Java Native Access) on Intel x64 Windows systems.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Use Case:</b> This class is intended as the foundational building block
 * for a symbolic numeric system capable of supporting exact arithmetic, explainable AI,
 * and other applications requiring deterministic, transparent, and high-precision math
 * without relying on hardware floating-point units.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The structure cannot be rearranged or simplified in-place
 * because {@code c} (and other denominators) can validly be zero to represent symbolic states.
