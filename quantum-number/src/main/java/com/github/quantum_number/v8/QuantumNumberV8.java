/**
 * Represents a symbolic, exact, and mutable numeric unit designed for
 * infinite-precision arithmetic across the full number line.
 *
 * <p>This structure models numbers as a fixed expression of the form:
 * <pre>
 *     (a / (b / c)) * (d / (e / f))
 * </pre>
 * where each of {@code a, b, c, d, e, f} are composed of four 64-bit words,
 * allowing 256-bit precision per component.
 *
 * <p><b>Key Characteristics:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Exact Math:</b> No floating-point rounding errors or approximations.
 *       All operations are represented structurally and precisely.</li>
 *   <li><b>Mutable Structure:</b> Fields can be incremented or decremented to
 *       perform arithmetic operations.</li>
 *   <li><b>Division by Zero Supported:</b> Dividing by zero is a valid state,
 *       representing symbolic or dual-purpose numbers rather than errors.</li>
 *   <li><b>Signed Zero:</b> Metadata fields encode sign information allowing
 *       distinction between +0 and -0, which is meaningful throughout computations.</li>
 *   <li><b>Coefficient Scaling:</b> The second half
 *       <code>(d / (e / f))</code> acts as a scaling coefficient that can
 *       scale the base number arbitrarily up or down via additive increments.</li>
 *   <li><b>Instant Multiplication and Division:</b> Multiplication and division
 *       by powers of two or other factors are performed by simple addition or
 *       incrementing internal fields — no actual CPU multiplication or division
 *       instructions are required.</li>
 *   <li><b>Array Representation:</b> An array of {@code QuantumNumberV8} instances
 *       represents a sum of numbers, supporting exact addition across the infinite
 *       number line and enabling precise linear combinations.</li>
 *   <li><b>Intel x64 Memory Layout:</b> The class layout models native 256-bit
 *       words to facilitate efficient memory-mapped access and native calls
 *       via JNA (Java Native Access) on Intel x64 Windows systems.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Use Case:</b> This class is intended as the foundational building block
 * for a symbolic numeric system capable of supporting exact arithmetic, explainable AI,
 * and other applications requiring deterministic, transparent, and high-precision math
 * without relying on hardware floating-point units.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The structure cannot be rearranged or simplified in-place
 * because {@code c} (and other denominators) can validly be zero to represent symbolic states.

/**
 * Represents a symbolic, exact, and mutable numeric unit designed for
 * infinite-precision arithmetic across the full number line.
 *
 * <p>This Java class serves as a **high-level model** for a future x64 MASM (assembly) implementation
 * of a 256-bit fixed-precision numeric system.
 * The class layout and field organization are intentionally designed to map directly onto
 * native 64-bit registers and memory words used in Intel x64 assembly.
 *
 * <h2>Mapping to x64 MASM Implementation</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>256-bit Components as 4×64-bit Words:</b> Each component (a, b, c, d, e, f) is
 *       modeled as four 64-bit {@code long} fields. In MASM, these correspond naturally to
 *       four 64-bit registers or contiguous memory slots, enabling efficient multi-precision
 *       arithmetic using standard 64-bit instructions.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>Multi-Precision Arithmetic:</b> Operations such as addition and multiplication
 *       can be implemented using the {@code adc} (add with carry) and {@code mul/imul} instructions,
 *       handling carry propagation across the 64-bit segments precisely as modeled by the
 *       four {@code long} fields per component.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>Instant Multiplication/Division by Powers of Two or Small Factors:</b> Shifts
 *       ({@code shl}, {@code shr}) and {@code lea} (load effective address) instructions
 *       enable efficient scaling by powers of two or small integers without costly CPU
 *       multiplication or division instructions. This design is reflected in the Java
 *       model as simple field increments or bit shifts on the corresponding parts.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>Symbolic Division by Zero and Signed Zero:</b> The model supports denominators
 *       being zero to represent symbolic or special numeric states rather than errors.
 *       Metadata fields encode sign information, including distinct +0 and -0 states,
 *       which can be represented and tracked efficiently using assembly flags or dedicated
 *       register bits.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>Efficient Memory Layout and Native Access:</b> The class's fixed layout aligns
 *       with 256-bit native words, facilitating memory mapping and direct calls from native
 *       code (e.g., via JNA). This ensures cache-friendly access patterns and straightforward
 *       integration with assembly routines.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Benefits of This Model</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Enables prototyping of symbolic numeric algorithms in Java before porting to
 *       low-level assembly.</li>
 *   <li>Provides a direct conceptual mapping to x64 MASM instructions and registers,
 *       reducing complexity in translation.</li>
 *   <li>Supports precise control over arithmetic operations, flags, and special states,
 *       essential for deterministic, exact arithmetic.</li>
 *   <li>Facilitates high-performance, low-level implementations for future hardware or
 *       specialized numeric processors.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> To optimize further, consider implementing helper methods for
 * multi-precision carry operations, bit shifts, and small-factor scaling, which will
 * directly correspond to MASM subroutines and instruction sequences.

	 * (1234 /( 1 / 1)) * (1e22 / (1 / 1)) +(left pointer to:)
	 * (1234 /( 1 / 1)) * (1 / (1e38 / 1))

	 * (5/1/1)*(1/1.55/1) x(right pointer to:)
	 * (USD/NZD/0)*(1/1/1)   (divide by zero prevents collapse)
	 *
	 * Use your own creative ways to multiply and divide e.g.
	 * Multiplying by 2 corresponds to doubling b or d.
     * Dividing by 3 could be represented by changing b from 1 to 3 or adjusting d or f.
	 * But really you can do it any way that suits your optimization pathway
	 *
	 * Signed zeros are used for quantitions
	 * (adding quantum numbers element by element as a symbolic dual nature numeric reversible
	 * transform), the quantite (quantum number used to transform) is simply added
	 * but for -0, it means inverse the sign
	 *
	 * Code must explicitly carry etc.
	 *
	 * MASM code should alleviate the need for FP side chips
	 * But there could be FP optimization chips for collapsing non-dual rational
	 * compatible numbers to base 10 or scientific display format

	 * Future Extensions: Liquid and Gas Simulation
	 *
	 * This structure serves as the numeric substrate for modeling ultra-realistic physical simulations,
	 * including liquids and gases, without relying on approximate floating-point physics.
	 *
	 * ▸ Liquids will be modeled as bonded QuantumNumberV8 instances in a spherical topology,
	 *   using elliptic curve mathematics (e.g., secp256k1). Each liquid particle can be treated as
	 *   a node with (x, y, k) coordinates representing its spatial or waveform position on the curve.
	 *   Bonding behavior, flow dynamics, and surface tension can emerge from the deterministic structure
	 *   and symbolic relationships between these nodes.
	 *
	 * ▸ Gases will be represented as sparse, loosely connected QuantumNumberV8 instances,
	 *   distributed across space with minimal bonding. Their motion and interactions can be governed
	 *   symbolically using thermodynamic laws or probabilistic rules encoded in metadata and pointers.
	 *
	 * This model allows:
	 *  - Symbolic and reversible simulation of physical systems
	 *  - Avoidance of floating-point drift, rounding errors, or chaotic instability
	 *  - Integration of symbolic units (kg, m/s², etc.) directly into calculations
	 *
	 * These ideas lay the groundwork for physically-plausible simulation engines, high-fidelity games,
	 * or scientific visualization platforms where every numeric operation is exact and explainable.
	 *
	 * The QuantumNumberV8 structure — combined with pointer trees and symbolic metadata — acts as a
	 * "physics substrate" for both real-world simulations and virtual environments.

	 * The use of 256-bit precision per component, combined with linked-tree structures

     * === ECC Math and QuantumNumberV8 Overview ===
     *
     * QuantumNumberV8 provides a fixed 256-bit precision numeric substrate
     * ideal for implementing elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) operations with:
     *
     * 1. Native 256-bit components (a–f), each represented as four 64-bit longs,
     *    matching typical ECC prime fields like secp256k1 used in blockchain tech.
     *
     * 2. Ultra-fast arithmetic using MASM-level instructions (ADC, MUL, SHL, LEA)
     *    that directly operate on the 64-bit segments without BigInteger overhead.
     *
     * 3. Symbolic and exact math without floating-point rounding errors or
     *    approximations, ensuring deterministic and reversible computations.
     *
     * 4. Reversibility: Each arithmetic step (e.g., scalar multiplication ladder)
     *    can be linked through right pointers, preserving the full operation trace.
     *    This supports backtracking, debugging, and symbolic tracing of ECC computations.
     *
     * 5. Sign and metadata bits encode special states such as +0 and -0, symbolic
     *    units (e.g., "kg", "USD"), and flags for symbolic or dual-purpose numeric states.
     *
     * 6. The structure models ECC points (x, y) naturally as QuantumNumberV8
     *    instances, enabling complex point operations and scalar multiplication
     *    entirely within this framework.
     *
     * 7. Instant multiplication and division by powers of two or small integers
     *    are implemented via simple field increments or bit shifts, mirroring
     *    efficient MASM instruction usage and avoiding costly CPU multiplication.
     *
     * 8. Linked pointer trees (left, right, up, down, in, out) allow representing
     *    sums, products, powers, logs, and other symbolic relationships essential
     *    for cryptographic, physical, or symbolic numeric modeling.
     *
     * 9. This design enables ECC implementations that are both:
     *    - High-performance (low-level, native-memory mapped)
     *    - Highly explainable and auditable (symbolic, reversible, exact)
     *
     * 10. Potential applications include:
     *    - Reversible ECC accelerators without floating-point hardware
     *    - Symbolic cryptographic proofs and debugging tools
     *    - Physically plausible numeric simulations embedding ECC-based transformations
     *
     * Overall, QuantumNumberV8 acts as a foundation for symbolic numeric systems
     * that support exact, deterministic, and explainable ECC math alongside
     * rich metadata and reversible state tracking.
