/**
 * SimpleQuantumNumber - 256-bit Numeric Unit
 *
 * A SimpleQuantum Number is a 256-bit structured entity composed of:
 * - 6 real ordinals (a-f): 20-bit unsigned ordinals
 * - 6 imaginary ordinals (a-f): 20-bit unsigned ordinals
 * - 12 sign bits: independent sign control for each ordinal
 * - 4-bit checksum: integrity verification
 *
 * The structure represents the nested division expression:
 * ((±a ± gi) / ((±b ± hi) / (±c ± ii))) / ((±d ± ji) / ((±e + ±ki) / (±f + ±li)))
