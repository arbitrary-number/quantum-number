Copyright 2025 Arbitrary Number Project Team

This project defines and claims the following concepts and terminology:

- Quantum Number — a 256-bit atomic symbolic numeric unit for exact math and quantum arithmetic
- Quantum Operating System (QOS) — an AI-native OS architecture built on symbolic computation
- Quantum File System (QFS) — a symbolic, math-native storage system for persistent computation
- Quantum AST — a symbolic abstract syntax tree for structured, ordered quantum math
- Quantition — a transformation that symbolically evaluates divide-by-zero and symbolic expressions
