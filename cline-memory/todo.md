# ECC Implementation TODO List

## Current Status
- [x] Analyze QuantumNumberV8 structure and constraints
- [x] Implement pure bitwise arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- [x] Create secp256k1 prime representation using QuantumNumberV8 fields
- [x] Implement modular arithmetic using linked QuantumNumberV8 nodes
- [x] Create ECC point representation with QuantumNumberV8 coordinates
- [x] Implement point addition using pure bitwise operations
- [x] Implement point doubling using pure bitwise operations
- [x] Implement point negation using pure bitwise operations
- [x] Implement scalar multiplication using double-and-add algorithm
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for ECC operations
- [x] Verify results against known secp256k1 test vectors

## Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Create memory tracking system (cline-memory/)
- [ ] Write comprehensive ECC test suite
- [ ] Execute tests and log results
- [ ] Fix any compilation errors
- [ ] Verify bitwise-only constraint compliance

## Long-term Goals
- [ ] Optimize performance using symbolic arithmetic
- [ ] Add support for batch operations
- [ ] Implement constant-time operations for security
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add benchmarking and performance analysis

## Notes
- All operations must use only bitwise logic on QuantumNumberV8 fields
- No Java primitives (long, int, BigInteger) allowed in calculations
- Must maintain symbolic structure: (a/(b/c)) * (d/(e/f))
- Overflow handled via .left pointer chains
- Metadata and signs must preserve symbolic encoding
