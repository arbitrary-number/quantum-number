# ECC Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a pure bitwise secp256k1 ECC library using QuantumNumberV8 structures with no Java primitives.

## Architecture
- **Core Structure**: QuantumNumberV8 with 6 components (a,b,c,d,e,f) each having 4 64-bit fields
- **Arithmetic**: Pure bitwise operations (&, |, ^, <<, >>) on internal fields only
- **Overflow**: Linked nodes via `.left` pointer for multi-limb arithmetic
- **Symbolic Form**: Maintain (a/(b/c)) * (d/(e/f)) structure throughout

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Arithmetic (COMPLETED)
- [x] Bitwise addition with carry propagation
- [x] Bitwise subtraction with borrow handling
- [x] Bitwise multiplication using bit manipulation
- [x] Modular reduction for secp256k1 prime
- [x] Linked node overflow management

### Phase 2: ECC Operations (COMPLETED)
- [x] Point addition: P + Q using symbolic arithmetic
- [x] Point doubling: 2P using tangent method
- [x] Point negation: -P using prime subtraction
- [x] Scalar multiplication: k*P using double-and-add
- [x] Modular inverse using extended Euclidean algorithm

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Execute tests and verify results
- [ ] Fix any compilation/runtime errors
- [ ] Validate against known secp256k1 test vectors

### Phase 4: Optimization (FUTURE)
- [ ] Implement constant-time operations
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Optimize for specific use cases
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Key Constraints
- **No Java Primitives**: long, int, BigInteger forbidden in calculations
- **Bitwise Only**: All math uses & | ^ << >> operations
- **Symbolic Preservation**: Maintain QuantumNumberV8's symbolic structure
- **Linked Overflow**: Use .left pointers for extended precision

## Test Coverage Plan
1. **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, modular reduction
2. **ECC Operations**: Point addition, doubling, negation, scalar multiplication
3. **Edge Cases**: Infinity points, overflow conditions, boundary values
4. **Validation**: Verify against known secp256k1 test vectors
5. **Symbolic Integrity**: Ensure metadata and signs are preserved

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass with real computed results
- No Java primitive usage in mathematical operations
- Symbolic structure maintained throughout
- Correct ECC point arithmetic verified
- Performance meets requirements

## Risk Mitigation
- Extensive logging in cline-memory/ for debugging
- Incremental testing approach
- Fallback implementations for complex operations
- Comprehensive error handling
